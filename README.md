How to Use:
1) Generate Array: Click the "Generate Array" button to create a new random array of elements that will be sorted.

2) Set Array Size: Adjust the size of the array by using the "Array Size" slider. This will change the number of elements in the array for sorting.

3) Adjust Sorting Speed: Use the "Speed" slider to control how fast the sorting process runs. You can slow it down to see the algorithm steps more clearly or speed it up for faster visualization.

4) Choose Algorithm: Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, or Quick Sort) from the dropdown menu.

5) Sort : Click the "Sort" button to start the sorting process. The array will be sorted according to the selected algorithm, and you will see the step-by-step animation of the sorting process.

6) Time Complexity: The time complexity for the selected sorting algorithm will be displayed during the process so you can learn how efficient the algorithm is at different array sizes.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For the basic structure of the web page.

CSS: For styling the page and the sorting visualizations.

JavaScript: For implementing the sorting algorithms and controlling the animations.
